# Stanborough-Navigation-App

These files are Unity scripts attached to game objects. 

This is the follow up to a previous repository in which I wrote out the backend algorithms used to build matrices, interface with the database and carry out pathfinding.
This code from there has been copied into this project and has been split up into different scripts and game objects.
